0;Gabi Barbash;After several weeks of foot-dragging, Prof. Gabi Barbash has been appointed to head the Israeli government's task force to combat Covid-19. He is the former CEO of Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv and a former director general in the Ministry of Health. Barbash is a professor of epidemiology and preventive medicine;
1;vaccine;There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19);
2;virus  spread; The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person;
3;how to wash hands;Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing;
4;if soup is not readily available;If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry;
5;what to do inside your home;Avoid close contact with people who are sick.If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members;
6;what to do outside you house;Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus;
7;symptoms;Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19;
8;kinds of tests;A viral test tells you if you have a current infection. An antibody test might tell you if you had a past infection. An antibody test might not show if you have a current infection because it can take 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies. Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last;
9;negative test;If you test negative for COVID-19 by a viral test, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing. You might test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during your illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then;
10; will warn wether halp;It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing;
11;face musk for children;CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth in public settings when around people not living in your household, particularly where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance;
12;disabilities ;Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.  Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.People with certain disabilities might experience higher rates of chronic health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities.You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed;
13;tracing;Contact tracing is used by health departments to prevent the spread of infectious disease. In general, contact tracing involves identifying people who have an infectious disease (cases) and their contacts (people who may have been exposed) and working with them to interrupt disease transmission. For COVID-19, this includes asking cases to isolate and contacts to quarantine at home voluntarily;
14; Pets;At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.  A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19;
